This problem is a regression one where we try to find out the average review of 
a board game given its other features

The dataset contains 20 columns and 81312 rows and the columns are

1. id                            
2. type                     
3. name                    
4. yearpublished                   
5. minplayers                       
6. maxplayers                       
7. playingtime                      
8. minplaytime                      
9. maxplaytime                      
10. minage                           
11. users_rated                      
12. average_rating                   
13. bayes_average_rating             
14. total_owners                     
15. total_traders                    
16. total_wanters                    
17. total_wishers                    
18. total_comments                   
19. total_weights                    
20. average_weight                   

In this example we use Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithms for average
rating predictions.
